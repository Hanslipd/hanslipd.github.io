    </header>
    <main>
        <p>I am a dedicated professional with extensive experience in security, leadership, and mentoring. My career has led me to work at a Canadian Armed Forces base, where I contribute to the safety and operational effectiveness of our personnel and facilities.</p>

        <p>In addition to my full-time role, I serve part-time as a Civilian Instructor with the Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Program. This position allows me to mentor young cadets, helping them develop discipline, confidence, and leadership skills that will serve them throughout their lives.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, I am a proud husband and father of three. My family is my foundation and greatest source of inspiration. I strive to lead by example, both at home and in my professional life, living by values of integrity, respect, and service to others.</p>
